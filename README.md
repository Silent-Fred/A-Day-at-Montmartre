# A Day at Montmartre
A project to reproduce images using geometric shapes.

This project is heavily inspired by https://github.com/fogleman/primitive yet
completely rewritten with the -- almost usual -- educational thought in mind.
Trying to squeeze in code fragments that hopefully illustrate the basic idea
of what is going on.
